# Year_3_Project_Uni
Project name:  Why Robots Canâ€™t Juggle: The difference between human and computer vision.

  -Application of computer vision in combination with mechanical system to demonstrate the difference between human and robotic vision and reaction. 
  -Made use of a Raspberry Pi and camera to capture the path of a moving object and calculate its future position in real time during motion.
  -Made use of Arduino and circuit system to traslate the position of the object to the motor, to then a move a capture mechanism towards it.

Additionally: 
  - Made use of pygame
  - Made use of opencv
  - Made use of numpy
